# typomaster-app
TypoMaster is a creative HTML-based assistant that transforms plain responses into expressive, animated typography.  
Built with Node.js + OpenAI Assistants API + HTML/CSS/JS magic ✨

## 🧠 What it does

- You write a sentence
- The assistant replies with an emotional, typographic HTML animation
- The message is then saved as a simple chat bubble
- You can click on any message to replay the animation
